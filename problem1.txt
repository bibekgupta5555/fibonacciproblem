Algorithm for problem:
1.)Let us take two numbers , one even and one odd numbers:
Using while loop to find odd number values and fibonacci sequence first values.
2.)In result we will obtain even number and every time we get even valued terms while doing sum.
3.)Using if else ,i will break the loop if the value exceeds greater than 4 million.
